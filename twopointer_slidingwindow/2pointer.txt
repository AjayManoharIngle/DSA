1. constant window : max sum from consecative array which is window size is 4 
-> take two pointer l=0 and r=k-1 and update sum till r < n
-> sum = sum -arr[l], l++, r++, sum = sum+arr[r], take max = max(max,sum)

2. Longest subarray and sub string where <condition> like s <= k 
-> genrating all sub array - brute force 
-> expand - r and shrink - l

3. no of subarray with some condition like sum <= k 
-> solve using no of sub array with sum <=k =>x
-> solve using no of sub arry with sum <=k-1 => y
-> always => x-y

4. short/min window with some condition :
-> shrink window and store it
